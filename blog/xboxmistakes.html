					Introduction
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Xbox is a gaming console, which has been
					introduced by Microsoft Corporation in late 2001
					and competed with the Sony Playstation 2 and the
					Nintendo GameCube. Microsoft wanted to prevent
					the Xbox from being used with copied games, unofficial
					applications and alternative operating systems,
					and therefore designed and implemented a
					security system for this purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					This article is about the security system of the
					Xbox and the mistakes Microsoft made. It will not
					explain basic concepts like buffer exploits, and it
					will not explain how to construct an effective security
					system, but it will explain how not to do it: This
					article is about how easy it is to make terrible mistakes
					and how easily people seem to overestimate
					their skills. So this article is also about how to avoid
					the most common mistakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					For every security concept, this article will first
					explain the design from Microsoft's perspective, and
					then describe the hackers' efforts to break the security.
					If the reader finds the mistakes in the design,
					this proves that Microsoft has weak developers. If,
					on the other hand, the reader doesn't find the mistakes,
					this proves that constructing a security system
					is indeed hard.
				</p>

				<section id="xboxhardware">
				<h2>
					The Xbox Hardware
				</h2>
				<p>
					Because Microsoft had a very tight time frame for
					the development of the Xbox, they used off-theshelf
					PC hardware and their Windows and DirectX
					technologies as the basis of the console. The Xbox
					consists of a Pentium III Celeron mobile 733 MHz
					CPU, 64 MB of RAM, a GeForce 3 MX with TV
					out, a 10 GB IDE hard disk, an IDE DVD drive,
					Fast Ethernet, as well as USB for the gamepads. It
					runs a simplified Windows 2000 kernel, and the
					games include adapted versions of Win32, libc and
					DirectX statically linked to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although this sounds a lot more like a PC than, for
					example, a GameCube with its PowerPC processor,
					custom optical drive and custom gamepad connectors,
					it is important to point out that, from a hardware
					point of view, the Xbox shares all properties of
					a PC: It has LPC, PCI and AGP busses, it has IDE
					drives, it has a Northbridge and a Southbridge, and
					it includes all the legacy PC features such as the
					“PIC” interrupt controller, the “PIT” timer and the
					A20 gate. nVidia sold a slightly modified Southbridge
					and a Northbridge with another graphics
					core embedded for the PC market as the “nForce”
					chipset between 2001 and 2002.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="motivationforsecsys">
				<h2>
					Motivation for the Security System
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Xbox being a PC, it should be trivial to install
					Linux on it in order to have a cheap and, for that
					time, powerful PC. Even today, a small and silent
					733 MHz PC with TV connectivity for 149 USD/
					EUR is still attractive. But this is not the only thing
					Microsoft wanted to prevent. There are three uses
					that should not have been possible:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<b>Linux:</b> The hardware is subsidized and money is
					gained with the games, therefore people should not
					be able to buy an Xbox without the intent to buy
					any games. Microsoft apparently feels that allowing
					the Xbox to be used as a (Linux) computer
					would be too expensive for them.
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Homebrew/Unlicensed:</b> Microsoft wants the
					software monopoly on the Xbox platform. Nobody
					should be able to publish unlicensed software,
					because Microsoft wants to gain money with the
					games to amortize the hardware losses, and because
					they do not want anyone to release non-Internet
					Explorer browsers and non-Windows Media
					Player multimedia software.
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Copies:</b> Obviously it is important to Microsoft that
					it is not possible to run copied games on the Xbox.
					Microsoft decided to design a single security system
					that was supposed to make Linux, homebrew/unlicensed software and copies impossible. The idea
					to accomplish this was by simply locking out all
					software that is either not on the intended (original)
					medium or not by Microsoft.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					On the one hand, this idea makes the security system
					easier and there are less possible points off attack.
					But on the other hand, 3 times more attackers
					have a single security system to hack: Although
					Open Source and Linux people, homebrew developers,
					game companies as well as crackers have little
					common interests, they could unite in this case and
					jointly hack the Xbox security system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the three consoles of its generation, Xbox,
					Playstation 2 and GameCube, the Xbox is the one
					whose security system has been compromised first,
					the one that is now easiest to modify for a hobbyist,
					the one with the most security system workarounds,
					and the one with the most powerful hacks. This may
					be, because the Xbox security is the weakest one of
					the three, but also because Open Source people,
					homebrew people and crackers attacked the Xbox,
					while the Open Source people did not attack the
					Playstation 2, as Linux had been officially supported
					by Sony, so the total number of hackers was lower,
					buying them time.

				<h2>
					Idea of the Security System
				</h2>
				<p>
					In order to allow only licensed and authentic code
					to run, it is necessary to build a TCPA/Palladiumlike
					chain of trust, which reaches from system boot
					to the actual execution of the game. The first link is
					from the CPU to the code in ROM, which includes
					the Windows kernel, and the second link is from the
					kernel to the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are several reasons that the operating system
					is contained in ROM (256 KB) instead of being
					stored on hard disk, like on a PC. First, it allows a
					faster startup, as the kernel can initialize while the
					hard disk is spinning up, furthermore, there is one
					link less in the chain of trust, and in case verification
					of the kernel gets compromised, it is harder to
					overwrite a ROM chip than modify data on a hard
					disk.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="startupsecurity">
				<h2>
					Startup Security
				</h2>
				<p>
					When turned on, x86-compatible CPUs start at the
					address 0xFFFFFFF0 in the address space, which is
					usually flash memory. For the Xbox, this is obviously
					no good idea, as flash memory can be:
					<ul>
					<li>replaced, by removing the chip, fitting a socket
					and inserting a replacement chip.</li>
					<li>overridden, by adding another flash memory chip
					to the LPC bus. This override functionality is necessary,
					because during manufacturing, an empty flash
					memory chip gets soldered onto the board, an override
					LPC ROM chip gets connected to the board and
					the system boots from the external ROM, which
					then programs the internal flash memory. This procedure
					is significantly cheaper than preprogramming
					the flash memory chips.</li>
					<li>reprogrammed, because flash memory can be
					written to many times. It would be possible to use
					ROM instead of flash memory, but ROM is more
					expensive than flash memory.
					Thus, the machine must not start from flash memory.</li>
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="microsoftperspective">
				<h2>
					Microsoft's Perspective
				</h2>
				<p>
					It would be possible to make two of the attacks
					impossible, by using ROM chips instead of flash.
					There would be no way to reprogram them, and it
					would be possible to disable the LPC override functionality
					in the chipset, because it is not needed for
					the manufacturing process any more.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="thehiddenrom">
				<h2>
					The Hidden ROM
				</h2>
				<p>
					There is a solution between flash memory and
					ROM that combines advantages of both these approaches.
					This trick is rather old and had already
					been used in previous gaming consoles like the
					Nintendo 64: Use a tiny non-replaceable startup
					ROM, and put the bulk of the firmware data (i.e. the
					Windows kernel) into flash memory. The “internal”
					ROM checks whether the contents of the flash
					memory are authentic, and if yes, it passes execution
					to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					This way, there will be another link in the chain of
					trust, but the ROM code can be trusted (if it is nonreplaceable),
					and if, in addition, it is non-accessible,
					an attacker may not even have a clue how verification
					works.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="locationoftherom">
				<h2>
					Location of the ROM
				</h2>
				<p>
					But where can this ROM be put? It cannot be a
					separate chip, as it would be replaceable. It would
					have to be included into another chip. The CPU
					would be ideal, as the ROM contents would not
					travel over any visible bus, but then it would be
					impossible to use cheap off-the-shelf Celerons.
					Including it in any other chip would make it nonreplaceable,
					but data would travel over a bus. It
					seems to be a good compromise to store the ROM
					data in the Southbridge (”MCPX”), as it is connected
					via the very fast HyperTransport bus, so it is
					very hard to sniff. A former Microsoft employee
					confirmed that the developers thought that nobody
					was able to sniff HyperTransport.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="verificationalgorithm">
				<h2>
					Verification Algorithm
				</h2>
				<p>
					This secret ROM stored in the Southbridge must
					verify the Windows kernel in the external flash
					memory before executing it. One idea would be to
					checksum (hash) the flash contents using an algo-
					rithm like MD5 or SHA-1, but this would mean that
					the hash of the kernel has to be stored in the secret
					ROM as well, which would make it imposible to
					ship updated versions of the kernel in future Xboxes
					without also updating the ROM contents - which
					would be very expensive.
				</p>
				<p>
					A digital signature algorithm like RSA would be
					better: It would be possible to update the kernel
					without changing the ROM, but an RSA implementation
					takes up a lot of space, and embedded
					ROM in the Southbridge is expensive. It would be
					ideal if the algorithm fit in only 512 bytes, which is
					impossible for RSA.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="secondbootloader">
				<h2>
					Second Bootloader (”2bl”)
				</h2>
				<p>
					A solution for this problem is again to introduce
					another link in the chain of trust: The ROM only
					hashes a small loader (”2bl”, “second bootloader”)
					in flash memory, which can never be changed. It is
					then the job of this loader to verify the rest of flash,
					and as the second loader can be any size, there are
					no restrictions.
				</p>
				<p>
					So the final chain of trust looks like this: The CPU
					boots from the secret ROM embedded into the
					Southbridge, which cannot be changed. The secret
					ROM verifies the second bootloader in flash memory
					using a hash algorithm, and if it is authentic,
					runs it. The second bootloader checks the kernel,
					and if authentic, runs it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the second bootloader and the Windows kernel
					would be stored in flash memory in plain text,
					which is a bad idea: An attacker can immediately
					see how the second bootloader verifies the integrity
					of the kernel, and even analyze the complex kernel
					for possible exploits. Encrypting all the flash contents
					will not solve possible vulnerability problems,
					but it will buy us time until the decryption of the
					flash contents is understood by hackers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The decryption key would have to be stored in the
					secret ROM, and the 2bl verification code would
					also have to decrypt the flash contents into RAM
					while reading it.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="raminitialization">
				<h2>
					RAM Initialization
				</h2>
				<p>
					Decrypting flash memory contents into RAM is a
					challenge if we are living inside the first few hundred
					bytes of code after the machine has started up:
					At this point, RAM might not be stable yet. The
					reason for this is that Microsoft bought cheap RAM
					chips; they just took everything Samsung could give
					them to lower the price, even faulty ones, i.e. chips
					that will be unstable when clocked at the highest
					frequencies specified.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Xbox is supposed to find out the highest clock
					speed the RAM chips can go and run them at this
					frequency - this is the reason why some games don't
					run as smoothly on some Xboxes as on others. So
					the startup code in the secret ROM has to do a
					memory test, and if it fails, clock down the RAM,
					do another memory test, and if it fails again, clock
					down again, and so on, until the test succeeds or the
					RAM cannot be clocked down any further.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem now is that it is impossible to do
					complex RAM initialization, data decryption and
					hashing in 512 bytes. This code would need at least
					2 KB, which would be significantly more expensive,
					if embedded into the Southbridge.
				</p>
				<p>
					We could put the RAM initialization code, which
					is the biggest part of what the startup code needs to
					do, into flash memory, and call it from the secret
					ROM, but this would kill security, as an attacker
					could easily see the unencrypted code in flash,
					modify it and have the control of the machine right
					at the startup.
				</p>
				<p>
					The developers at Microsoft had a brilliant idea
					how to solve this problem: They designed an interpreter
					for a virtual machine that can read and write
					memory, access the PCI config space, do “AND”
					and “OR” calculations, jump conditionally etc. The
					instruction code has one byte instructions and two
					32 bit operands, it can use immediate values as well
					as an accumulator.
				</p>
				<p>
					The interpreter for the virtual machine is stored in
					the secret ROM, and its code (”xcodes”) is stored in
					flash memory. This code does the memory initialization
					(plus extra hardware initialization, which
					would not be necessary). This program cannot be
					encrypted, as there is again no space for it in the
					secret ROM, but as the virtual machine is unknown
					to the hacker, encryption should not be that important.
					It also cannot be hashed, as this would make it
					impossible to change the xcodes for later revisions
					of the Xbox hardware. Therefore we have to make
					sure that, if the hacker knows how the virtual machine
					works, it is impossible to do anything malicious
					with the xcodes.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="thevirtualmachine">
				<h2>
					The Virtual Machine
				</h2>
				<p>
					There are several ways an attacker could exploit
					the xcodes, which are by definition untrusted, because
					they reside in “external” flash memory. Microsoft
					included some code to make sure there were
					no possible exploits.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="readthesecretrom">
				<h2>
					Read the Secret ROM
				</h2>
				<p>
					The xcodes can read memory and access I/O ports.
					This way an attacker could place xcodes into flash
					memory that dump the secret ROM, which must be
					mapped into the address space somewhere, to a
					slow bus, like the LPC or the I2C bus, or write it
					into CMOS or the EEPROM, so that we can read it
					later.
				</p>
				<p>
					The xcode interpreter has to make sure that the
					xcodes cannot read the secret ROM, which is located
					at the upper 512 bytes of the address space.
					The simplest way to accomplish this is to mask the
					address when reading from memory:
<pre class="lang-c"><code>and ebx, 0FFFFFFFh; clear upper 4 bits
mov edi, [ebx] ; read from memory
jmp next_instruction</code></pre>
					This way, the xcodes can only ready from the
					lower 256 MB, which is no problem, as there are
					only 64 MB of RAM, and memory mapped I/O can
					be mapped into this region using PCI config cycles.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="turnoffthesecretrom">
				<h2>
					Turn off the Secret ROM
				</h2>
				<p>
					The xcodes may also not turn off the secret ROM,
					or else the CPU, while executing the xcode interpreter,
					would “fall down” from the secret ROM into
					the underlying flash ROM, which is also mapped to
					the top end of the address space. The turn off functionality
					is important: As soon as the second bootloader
					takes over, the secret ROM has to be turned
					off, or else an attack against a game, which makes it
					possible to run arbitrary code, could dump the secret
					ROM, making additional attacks against it possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					The secret ROM can be turned off by writing a
					value with bit #1 set to the PCI config space of device
					0:1:0, register 0x80. So the xcode interpreter
					always clears this bit in case there is a write to this
					PCI config space register:
<pre class="lang-c"><code>	cmp ebx, 80000880h ; MCPX disable?
	jnz short not_mcpx_disable; no
	and ecx, not 2 ; clear bit 1
not_mcpx_disable:
	mov eax, ebx
	mov dx, 0CF8h
	out dx, eax ; PCI configuration address
	add dl, 4
	mov eax, ecx
	out dx, eax ; PCI configuration data
	jmp short next_instruction</code></pre>
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="encryptionandhashing">
				<h2>
					Encryption and Hashing
				</h2>
				<p>
					For the decryption of the second bootloader, Microsoft
					chose the RC4 algorithm, which is pretty
					small, as it fits into 150 bytes. It uses a 16 byte key,
					which is also stored in the secret ROM. Microsoft's
					engineers also chose to use RC4 as a hash, so that
					no additional algorithm had to be implemented for
					this. Differential decryption algorithms feed the
					decrypted data into the generator of the decryption
					key stream, so if the encrypted code is changed at
					one byte, all the following bytes will decrypted incorrectly,
					up to the last bytes. This way, it is possible
					to only test the last few bytes. If they have been
					decrypted correctly, then the encrypted code has
					been authentic. (If you are getting suspicious now -
					read on!)
				</p>
				<p>
					In practice, the secret ROM in the Xbox compares
					the last decrypted 32 bit value with the constant of
					0x7854794A. If it is incorrect, the Xbox has to
					panic.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="paniccode">
				<h2>
					Panic Code
				</h2>
				<p>
					So far, the code in the secret ROM does this:
					<ul>
					<li>Enter protected mode, and set up segment descriptors,
					so that we have access to the complete
					flat 32 bit address space.</li>
					<li>Interpret the xcodes.</li>
					<li>Decrypt and hash the second bootloader, store it in
					RAM</li>
					<li>If the hash is correct, jump to the decrypted second
					bootloader in RAM, else panic.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					There is another possible attack here: A hacker
					could deliberately make the hash fail. If the Xbox
					then halts and flashes its lights to indicate an error,
					the attacker can attach a device to dump the secret
					ROM after the CPU has shut down and the bus is
					idle. Although HyperTransport is fast, it would be a
					lot easier to attach a device that actively requests the
					data from the Southbridge than sniffing it when the
					CPU requests it.
				</p>
				<p>
					One solution would be not to halt but to shut down
					the Xbox in case of a problem. The support chips
					have this functionality. But incorrect flash memory
					does not necessarily mean that there has been an
					attack, it could also be a malfunction, and the machine
					should use the LED to blink an error code.
					So we should leave the Xbox running, but just turn
					off the secret ROM, so that it cannot be read any
					more. But there is a problem: We have to do this
					inside the secret ROM. So if we disable the ROM,
					we cannot have the “hlt” instruction after that, because
					the CPU will “fall down” into flash memory -
					where an attacker could put code. On the other
					hand, if we halt the CPU, we cannot turn off the
					secret ROM afterwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					We cannot put the disable and halt code into RAM
					and jump there, because RAM might not be stable,
					and might even have been tampered with by an attacker
					(e.g. by turning off the memory controller
					using the xcodes) so that the secret ROM does not
					get turned off. We cannot put the disable and halt
					code into flash either, as again, an attacker could
					simply put arbitrary code to circumvent the complete
					system there.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Microsoft engineers used yet another brilliant
					trick: They jump to the very end of the address
					space (which is covered by the secret ROM) and
					turn off the secret ROM in the very last instruction 
					inside the address space. This is a simplified version
					of the idea:
<pre class="lang-c"><code>FFFFFFF1 mov eax, 80000880h
FFFFFFF6 mov dx, 0CF8h
FFFFFFF9 out dx, eax
FFFFFFFB add dl, 4
FFFFFFFC mov al, 2
FFFFFFFE out dx, al</code></pre>
					After the last instruction, the program counter
					(EIP) will overflow to 00000000, which, according
					to the CPU documentation, causes an exception, and
					as there is no exception handler set up, it causes a
					double fault, which will effectively halt the machine.

					The Hacker Perspective
				</h2>
				<p>
					So much for the theory. The design looked pretty
					good, although the trade off between cost and security
					as it has been decided, might give some people
					headaches. Let us now have a look at the Xbox from
					the hackers' point of view.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been well known that the Xbox chipset is a
					modified version of nVidia's nForce chipset, so we
					knew that it was standard IDE, USB, there was an
					internal PCI bus and so on. Two hackers from Great
					Britain, Luke and Andy, checked the hard disk and
					found out that it uses a custom partitioning scheme,
					a FAT-like filesystem, that there is no kernel on the
					hard disk, but there is the Xbox Dashboard on the
					fourth partition, the main program that gets executed
					if there is no game in the DVD drive, which
					allows changing settings, playing audio CDs and
					managing savegames.

				<h2>
					Extracting the Secret ROM
				</h2>
				<p>
					Andrew “bunnie” Huang, then a PhD student at the
					MIT, disassembled his Xbox, saw the flash memory,
					de-soldered it, extracted the contents, put it on his
					website and got a phone call from one of Microsoft's
					lawyers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The flash memory image was obviously encrypted,
					but there was x86 binary code in the upper 512
					bytes! Obviously, there should be no code in the
					upper 512 bytes, as this gets overridden by the secret
					ROM, which contains the actual machine setup
					and flash decryption code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bunnie found out that this code was an interpreter
					for tables in flash memory, plus a decryption function
					that looked like RC4. He rewrote the crypto
					code in C and tried it on the data - but the resulting
					data was random, obviously something was wrong.
					The interpreter didn't make much sense either. The
					code used opcodes that were unknown to the interpreter.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to find out what was wrong, bunnie rewrote
					the top of flash with his own code, and later
					even completely erased the upper 512 bytes, but the
					Xbox still booted! So it was obvious to him that this
					region gets overridden by some internal code. As it
					turned out later, the code in the upper 512 bytes of
					the flash image was a very old version of the secret
					ROM code, which had been unintentionally linked
					to the image by the build tools. It seems like nobody
					had looked at the resulting image at the end, before
					they shipped the consoles. This mistake was very
					close to a fatal one, and Microsoft was lucky that
					they didn't link the actual version of the secret
					ROM.
				</p>
				<p>
					But it didn't make that much of a difference, as
					bunnie sniffed the busses, and eventually dumped
					the complete secret ROM, including the RC4 key
					from HyperTransport, using a custom built sniffer -
					after all, he was working on his PhD degree about
					high performance computing, and he could use the
					excellent resources of the MIT hardware lab.
				</p>
				<p>
					When he published his findings, other people
					found out quite quickly that the validity check did
					nothing at all: The combination of decryption and
					hash with a cypher that feeds back the decrypted
					data into the key stream is a good idea, but unfortunately,
					RC4 is no such cypher. It decrypts bytes independently,
					so if one byte is wrong, all the following
					bytes will still be decrypted correctly. So
					checking the last four bytes has no effect: There is
					no hash.
				</p>
				<p>
					It turned out that the cypher used in the old version
					of the secret ROM as found in flash memory used
					the RC5 cypher. In contrast to RC4, RC5 does feed
					the decrypted stream back into the key stream. So
					they seem to have replaced RC5 with RC4 without
					understanding that RC4 cannot be used as a hash.
					Bunnie's theory why they abandoned RC5 is that
					RC5 was still a work in progress, and that Microsoft
					wasn't supposed to have it, so they went for the
					closest relative - RC4.

				<section id="modchips">
				<h2>
					Modchips
				</h2>
				<p>
					Now that the encryption key was known and there
					was effectively no hash over the second bootloader,
					it was possible to patch this code: People added
					code to the second bootloader to patch the kernel
					after decryption (and decompression) to accept executables
					even if on the wrong media (DVD-R instead
					of original) or if the RSA signature of the executables
					was broken (i.e. unsigned homebrew
					software).
				</p>
				<p>
					Modchips appeared: Some of them had a complete
					replacement flash memory chip on them, others only
					patches a few bytes and passed most reads down to
					the original flash chip. All these modchips had to be 
					soldered in parallel to the original flash chip, using
					31 wires.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now other people found out that, if the flash chip
					is completely missing, the Xbox wants to read from
					a (non-existant) ROM chip connected to the (serial)
					LPC bus. This is of course because of the manufacturing
					process: As it has been explained before, the
					flash chip gets programmed in-system, the first time
					they are turned on, using an external LPC ROM
					chip. Modchip makers soon developed chips that
					only needed 9 wires and connected to the LPC bus.
					It was enough to ground the data line D0 to make
					the Xbox think that flash memory is empty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lots of these “cheapermods” appeared, as they
					only consisted of a single serial flash memory chip.
					They could be installed within minutes, especially
					after some companies started shipping chips that
					used pogo pins, so that no soldering was required.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some groups wrote applications like boot menus
					that made it possible to copy games to hard disk and
					run them from there. Patched Xbox kernels appeared
					that supported bigger hard disks. Making the
					Xbox run copies from DVD-R or hard disk as well
					as homebrew applications written with the official
					Xbox SDK was now easy.

				<h2>
					Backdoors
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Xbox Linux Project was working on two ways
					to start Linux: Either run the Linux kernel from a
					CD/DVD as if it was a game, or run it directly from
					flash memory, or from HD/DVD using a Linux
					bootloader in flash memory, so that the Xbox behaved
					like a PC. For the latter, Xbox Linux was
					working on a replacement firmware.
				</p>
				<p>
					It would have been no problem to write a replacement
					firmware that took over execution instead of
					the second bootloader, as it was possible to completely
					replace this second bootloader, as well as
					encrypt it, using the well-known key from the secret
					ROM. But the firmware developers felt very uncomfortable
					with the idea of using this secret key in
					their GPL code. Other hackers felt the same, and
					thus were looking for bugs and backdoors in the
					secret ROM code, in order to find a way to be able
					to implement a replacement firmware without having
					to deal with encryption.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="thevisorbackdoor">
				<h2>
					The Visor Backdoor
				</h2>
				<p>
					A hacker named visor, who never revealed his real
					name, wondered whether the rollover to 00000000
					in case of an incorrect 2bl “hash” really caused a
					double fault and halted the CPU. He used the
					xcodes to write the assembly instruction for “jmp
					0xFFFF0000” to the memory location 00000000 in
					RAM and changed the last four bytes in 2bl, in order
					to make the secret ROM run the panic code. The
					Xbox happily continued executing code at
					00000000 and took the jump into flash.
				</p>
				<p>
					When appending these instructions to the existing
					xcodes, he could make sure that RAM had been
					properly initialized and was thus stable. So there
					was no need to encrypt the Xbox Linux bootloader
					firmware with the secret key any more. It was
					enough to add the memory write instruction to the
					end of the xcodes and make sure that 2bl decryption
					fails - which will automatically happen, if the firmware
					replacement does not contain the 2bl code.
					Now why is there no double fault? Hackers from
					the Xbox Linux team checked with AMD employees
					and they explained that AMD CPUs do throw an
					exception in case of EIP overflows, but Intel CPUs
					don't.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason that Intel CPUs don't is because of...
					1970s stuff. Execution on x86 CPUs starts at the top
					of the address space (minus 16 bytes), but some
					computer makers wanted to have their ROM at the
					bottom of the address space, i.e. at 0, so Intel implemented
					the instruction with the encoding
					0xFFFF, which is what you get when reading from
					addresses not connected to any chip, as a NoOperation
					(”nop”) and made the CPU throw no exception
					in case of the address space wraparound.
					This way, the CPU would “nop” its way up to the
					top, and finally execute the code at 0.
				</p>
				<p>
					AMD did not implement this behavior, as it had
					not been necessary any more by the time AMD entered
					the x86 market with it own designs, and because
					they felt that this behavior was a security risk
					and fixing it would not mean a significant incompatibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					But why did Microsoft do it wrong? This can be
					explained with the history of the Xbox: AMD offered
					to design and manufacture both the CPU and
					the motherboard (including the chipset), and nVidia
					was contracted to contribute the graphics hardware.
					The first developer systems, even outside of Microsoft,
					were Athlon-based, but then Intel came in and
					offered their chips for less money, as well as the
					complementary redesign of the existing AMD
					chipset to work with their CPU. Consequently,
					nVidia licensed the AMD chipset so that the AMD
					name vanished. This also means, that nVidia nForce
					chipset is essentially AMD technology, closely related
					to the AMD-760 chipset.
				</p>
				<p>
					So when Microsoft switched from AMD to Intel,
					they apparently forgot to test their security code
					again with the new hardware, or to read the Intel
					datasheets.

				<h2>
					The MIST Hack
				</h2>
				<p>
					Soon after the visor hack, another vulnerability
					was found in the secret ROM code, attacking the 
					code that checks whether an xcode wants to disable
					the secret ROM. Let us look at this code again:
 <pre class="lang-c"><code>cmp ebx, 80000880h ; MCPX disable?
 jnz short not_mcpx_disable; no
 and ecx, not 2 ; clear bit 1
not_mcpx_disable:
 mov eax, ebx
 mov dx, 0CF8h
 out dx, eax ; PCI configuration address
 add dl, 4
 mov eax, ecx
 out dx, eax ; PCI configuration data
 jmp short next_instruction</code></pre>
				</p>
				<p>
					The PCI config address is stored in the EBX register
					in the beginning. This address has to be sent to
					I/O port 0x0CF8, and the 32 bit data has to be sent
					to I/O port 0x0CFC. The address is encoded like
					this:
<pre class="lang-c"><code>0-7 reg
8-10 func
11-15 device
16-23 bus
24-30 reserved
31 always 1</code></pre>
				</p>
				<p>
					The attack is pretty obvoius: there are seven reserved
					bits in the address, and the code tests for a
					single exact value. What happens if we write to an
					alias of the same address, by using an address with
					only some of the bits 24 to 30 changed? While the
					instruction
				</p>
<pre class="lang-c"><code>POKEPCI(80000880h, 2)</code></pre>
				<p>
					will be caught, the instruction
				</p>
<pre class="lang-c"><code>POKEPCI(C0000880h, 2)</code></pre>
				<p>
					will not be caught - and works just as well, because
					the PCI bus controller just ignores the unused
					bits.
				</p>
				<p>
					This instruction disables the secret ROM, that is,
					the interpreter disables itself when sending the value
					to port 0x0CFC, and the CPU falls down to flash
					memory. We can put a “landing zone” into flash, by
					filling all of the top 512 bytes with “nop” instructions,
					and putting a jump to the beginning of flash
					into the last instruction, so that we do not have to
					care where exactly the CPU lands after falling
					down, and we are independent of possibly hard to
					reproduce caching effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is hard to find a good reason for this bug other
					than carelessness. It might be attributed to not
					reading the documentation closely enough, as well
					as not looking at it from the perspective of a hacker
					well enough. After all, this code had been written
					with a specific attack in mind - but the code made
					hacking easier, by giving hackers a hint how to attack.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="anotherpciconfig">
				<h2>
					Another PCI Config Space Attack
				</h2>
				<p>
					There is a second sequence of xcode instructions
					that can disable the secret ROM just as well, which
					are not caught by the interpreter: The interpreter
					supports writing bytes to I/O ports, so it is possible
					to put together the code to disable the secret ROM
					using 8 bit I/O writes:
				</p>
<pre class="lang-c"><code>OUTB(0xcf8), 0x80
OUTB(0xcf9), 0x08
OUTB(0xcfa), 0x00
OUTB(0xcfb), 0x80
OUTB(0xcfc), 0x02</code></pre>

					This hack has been unreleased until now. It has
					been found not long after the MIST hack, but kept
					secret, in case Microsoft fixed the MIST bug. In the
					meantime, they have implemented a fix that makes
					all hacks impossible that are based on turning off
					the secret ROM. This will be described in detail
					later.

					Microsoft had now understood that RC4 cannot be

					As there were only few bytes left, the hash
					algorithm had to be tiny - so the “Tiny Encryption
					Algorithm” (”TEA”) was used. Every encryption
					algorithm can be changed to be used as a hash, and
					TEA seemed to be a good choice, as it is really
					small. While they were at it, they also changed the

				<h2>
					The A20 Hack
				</h2>
				<p>
					To date, Microsoft does not know how the Xbox
					Linux Project did it. But since there will most
					probably be no future revisions of the Xbox, as the
					Xbox 360 has already taken over, we can release
					this now.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us start with some PC history. The 8086/8088,
					the first CPU in the x86 line, was supposed to be as
					closely compatible to the 8080, which was very
					successful on the CP/M market. The memory model
					therefore was similar to the 8080, which could access
					only 64 KB, by dividing memory into 64 KB
					blocks. Intel decided that the 8086/8088 could have
					a maximum of 1 MB of RAM, which would have
					meant 16 “segments” of 64 KB each. But instead of
					doing it this way, they decided to let the 64 KB
					segments overlap, and have 65536 of these segments,
					starting every 16 bytes.
				</p>
				<p>
					An address was therefore specified by a segment
					and an offset. The segment would be multiplied by
					16, and the offset would be added, to result in the
					effective address. As an example, 0x0040:0x006C
					would be 0x40*0x10+0x6C=0x46C. An interesting
					side effect of this method is that it is possible to
					have addresses above 1 MB: The segment 0xFFFF
					starts at the effective address 0xFFFF0, so it should
					only contain 16 bytes instead of 64 KB. So the address
					0xFFFF:0x0010 would be at 1 MB, and
					0xFFFF:0xFFFF would be at 1 MB plus roughly 64
					KB.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 8086/8088 could not address more than 1 MB,
					because it only had 20 address lines, so addresses
					above 0xFFFF:0x000F were wrapped around to the
					lower 64 KB. But this behavior was different on the
					286, which had 24 address lines: It was actually
					possible to access roughly 64 KB more using this
					trick, which was later abused by MS-DOS as “high
					memory”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately there were some 8086/8088 applications
					that broke, because they required the wraparound
					for some reason. It wasn't Intel who found
					that out, but IBM, when they designed the IBM AT,
					and it was too late to modify the behavior of the
					286, so they fixed it themselves, by introducing the
					A20 Gate (”A20#”). An unused I/O pin in the keyboard
					controller was attached to the 20th address
					line, so that software could pull down address line
					20 to 0, thus emulating the 8086/8088 behaviour.
					This feature was later moved into the CPUs, and
					all Pentiums and Athlons have it - and so does the
					Xbox. If A20# is triggered, bit 20 of all addresses
					will be 0. So, for example, an address of 1 MB will
					be 0 MB, and if the CPU wants to access the top of
					RAM, it will actually access memory that is 1 MB
					lower than the top.
				</p>
				<p>
					Keeping this in mind, the attack on the Xbox is
					pretty straightforward: If we connect the CPU's
					A20# pin to GND, the Xbox will not start from
					FFFFFFF0, but from FFEFFFF0 - this is not covered
					by the secret ROM, but is ordinary flash memory,
					because flash is mirrored over the upper 16
					MB. So by only connecting a single pin, the secret
					ROM is completely bypassed.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is cool about this, is that the secret ROM is
					still turned on. So we could easily dump the secret
					ROM trough one of the low speed busses (we used
					the I2C bus), by placing a small dump application
					into flash memory.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="theteahash">
				<h2>
					The TEA Hash
				</h2>
				<p>
					After reading Bruce Schneier's book on crypto, we
					learned that TEA was a really bad choice as a hash.
					The book says that TEA must never be used as a
					hash, because it is insecure if used this way. If you
					flip both bit 16 and 31 of a 32 bit word, the hash
					will be the same. We could easily patch a jump in
					the second bootloader so that it would not be recognized.
					This modified jump lead us directly into flash
					memory.
				</p>
				<p>
					But why did they make this mistake? Obviously
					the designers knew nothing about crypto - again! -
					and just added code without understanding it and
					without even reading the most basic books on the
					topic. A possible explanation why they chose TEA
					would be that they might have searched the internet
					for a “tiny” encryption algorithm - and got TEA.

				<h2>
					Visor Backdoor and MIST Hack
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Visor Backdoor was still present, so again, for
					the replacement Linux firmware, the Xbox Linux
					developers did not have to exploit the crypto code,
					but could simply use this backdoor. Microsoft obviously
					released the updated secret ROM much too
					quickly, just after bunnie dumped it and people saw
					that RC4 was no hash, but before the visor backdoor
					had been discovered.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MIST hack had been discovered after the visor
					bug - but it no longer worked on the Xbox 1.1. Not
					because they fixed the comparison - they didn't -,
					but because they changed the address logic: If you
					accessed the upper 512 bytes of the address space,
					and the secret ROM was turned off, the Xbox would
					just crash, thus making all “fall down” hacks impossible.
					This way they closed both possible attacks,
					writing to an alias, and using 5 OUTB instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Microsoft obviously discovered the turnoff vulnerability
					themselves, closing at least one backdoor,
					but keeping another one open, and not really closing
					a second one. It was too expensive to trash the 1.1
					Southbridge chips again for yet another update, so
					Microsoft still uses these chips in today's Xboxes.

				<p>
					In later revisions of the Xbox, Microsoft removed
					some pins of the LPC bus, making modchip design
					harder, but they could not remove the LPC bus altogether,
					because they needed it during the manufacturing
					process.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the latest revision of the Xbox hardware (v1.6),
					they finally switched from flash memory to real
					ROM - and even integrated the ROM with the video
					encoder. The LPC bus is not needed for manufacturing
					any more, as the ROM chips are already preprogrammed.
					So now it is impossible to replace or
					to overwrite the kernel image, and because of the
					missing LPC bus, it also seems impossible to attach
					a ROM override.
				</p>
				<p>
					But modchips are still possible. The obvious LPC
					pins are gone now, but the bus is still there. If you
					find the LPC pins on the board, you can attach a
					ROM override just as before, the modchips are only
					a bit harder to install. This is because the Southbridge
					still has the LPC override functionality, since
					they did not make a new revision of it - as so often,
					obviously for monetary reasons.

					Xbox Kernel Security
				</h2>
				<p>
					Let us have a look at the chain of trust again:
				</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The CPU starts execution of code stored in the
					secret ROM.</li>
					<li>The secret ROM decrypts and verifies the second
					bootloader.</li>
					<li>The second bootloader decrypts and verifies the
					Windows kernel.</li>
					<li>The Windows kernel checks the allowed media
					bits and the RSA signature of the game.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					This last link is a complete software thing, so all
					the attacks have been pretty much standard. Some
					people tried to brute force the RSA key used for the
					game signature - no joke! But what is more likely,
					successfully brute forcing RSA 2048, or finding a
					bug in Microsoft's security code? After the experience
					with the first links of the chain of trust, the
					Xbox Linux Project focused on finding bugs in the
					software.
				</p>
				<p>
					We found no bug in the RSA implementation. It is
					taken straight out of Windows 2000 and looks pretty
					good. But there are always implicit additional links
					in the chain of trust: All code reads data, and data
					can cause security risks if handled incorrectly.
				</p>

				<section id="gameexploits">
				<h2>
					Game Exploits
				</h2>
				<p>
					What data do games load? Graphics data, audio
					data, video data... - but we cannot alter them, because
					it is not easily possible to create authentic
					Xbox DVDs, and the Xbox won't boot originals
					from DVD-R etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					But most games can load savegames, and these can
					easily be changed: The Xbox memory units are
					more or less standard USB storage devices (”USB
					sticks”), so it is possible to use most USB sticks
					with the Xbox, and just store hacked savegames on
					them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plenty of Xbox games had buffer vulnerabilities in
					their savegame handlers. It was often as easy as extending
					the length of strings like the name of the
					player, and the game would overwrite its stack with
					our data and eventually jump to the code we embedded
					in the savegame.
				</p>
				<p>
					The procedure for the user was then to simply
					copy a hacked savegame from a USB stick onto the
					Xbox hard disk, run the game and load the savegame.
					But after a buffer exploit, we would normally
					only be in user mode - not on the Xbox, as all Xbox
					games run in kernel mode. The reason for this is
					probably a slight speed advantage, or, less likely, a
					simpler environment for the game, but Microsoft
					tried to make the environment as similar to the
					Windows/DirectX environment as possible, so user
					mode would have actually made the environment
					“simpler” for many Windows/DirectX developers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that we have full control of the machine, we
					can overwrite the flash memory chip. It is write
					protected by default, but disabling the write protection
					is as easy as soldering a single bridge on the
					motherboard. After all, this bridge has to be closed
					temporarily during manufacturing when programming
					flash memory for the first time. Using this
					hack, it is possible, only with a USB stick, one of
					several games (007 Agent Under Fire, MechAssault,
					Splinter Cell, ...) and a soldering iron, to permanently
					modify the Xbox, just as if a modchip was
					installed. Because early Xboxes had a 1 MB flash
					chip, although only 256 KB had been used, it was
					even possible to install several ROM images in flash
					and attach a switch.

					But the Xbox Linux Project did not blindly release
					this hack. The first savegame proof of concept exploit
					had been finished in January 2003. After that, a
					lot of energy was invested in finding out a way to
					free the Xbox for homebrew development and
					Linux, but not allowing game copies. Microsoft was
					contacted, but without any success. They just ignored
					the problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally in July, the hack was released, with heavy
					obfuscation, and lockout code for non-Linux use. It
					was obvious that this would only slow down the
					“hacking of the hack”, so eventually, people would
					be able to use this vulnerability for copied games,
					but since Microsoft showed no interest in finding a
					solution, there was no other option than full disclosure. 
					The suggestion of the Xbox Linux Project
					would have been to work together with Microsoft to
					silently close the security holes and, in return, work
					on a method to let homebrew and Linux run on the
					Xbox.

				<h2>
					Dashboard Exploits
				</h2>
				<p>
					The problem with the savegame hack was that, if
					you didn't want to overwrite the flash memory chip,
					you had to insert the game and load the savegame
					every time you wanted to run unsigned code. But
					having full control of the machine using the savegame
					exploit also meant we could access the hard
					disk without opening the Xbox. This way, it became
					interesting to closely examine the hard disk contents
					for vulnerabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Dashboard is the main program on hard disk,
					executed every time the Xbox is started without a
					game in the DVD drive. The dashboard may even
					be the very reason the Xbox ships with a hard disk:
					While the settings menu and savegame management
					on the Nintendo GameCube fit well into 2 MB of
					ROM, the Xbox Dashboard, which is roughly comparable
					in its functionality, occupies more than 100
					MB. So the original idea why to include a hard disk
					might have been initiated by the inability to compress
					the Dashboard into typical ROM sizes - and
					they might have decided to make the best out of it,
					and find additional uses for the hard disk.
					The dashboard loads its data files, like audio and
					graphics, from hard disk. With the savegame exploit,
					we can now alter the hard disk contents, even
					without opening the Xbox. Of course the dashboard
					executable is signed and can therefore not be altered,
					and all data files are hashed, with the hashes
					stored inside the dashboard executable. Well, all
					files, except for two: the font files.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequently, there was an integer vulnerability in
					the font handling routines, so that we could run our
					own code by replacing the font files. Combined with
					the savegame exploit, it was as easy as transferring
					the savegame and loading it, which would run a
					script that modifies the fonts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now every time the Xbox is turned on, the Dashboard
					crashes because of the faulty fonts and runs
					our code embedded in these files. Our code reloads
					the Dashboard with the original fonts, hacks it, and
					runs it. Hacking the Dashboard meant two things:
					Modifying one menu entry to read “XBOX
					LINUX” instead of “XBOX LIVE” and running the
					Linux bootloader instead of the Xbox Live setup
					executable, and modifying the kernel to accept both
					applications signed with Microsoft's RSA key as
					well as those signed with our RSA key, from hard
					disk and from CD/DVD. We called this “MechInstaller”,
					as it was based on the “MechAssault” savegame
					exploit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Only accepting code either signed by the original
					key or by our key, keeping our key secret, and using
					heavy obfuscation again, meant that nobody could
					easily abuse this solution for copied games.
					This hack shows several things: Hackers have
					phantasy, the combination of flaws can lead to fully
					compromising the security system, powerful privileged
					code should be bug-free and security code
					should really catch all cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and there is another vulnerability, and integer
					vulnerability in the audio player code. The attack
					was developed independently of the font attack, but
					was inferior because it would have required the user
					to enter the audio player every time to run Linux.

				<h2>
					Microsoft's Fixes
				</h2>
				<p>
					The history of Microsoft's reactions to the font
					vulnerability is the perfect lesson of how to do it
					wrong.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>After MechInstaller had been released, Microsoft
					fixed the buffer vulnerability in the Dashboard
					and distributed this new version over the Xbox
					Live network and shipped it with new Xboxes.</li>
					<li>For the hackers, this was no major problem: It
					was possible to downgrade the Dashboard of a
					new Xbox to the vulnerable version. Just run
					Linux using a savegame exploit, and “dd” the old
					image. Some people felt downgrading on new
					Xboxes was not piracy, because after all, Microsoft
					upgraded Xbox Live users' hard disks to the
					new version without asking.</li>
					<li>As the next step, Microsoft blacklisted the old
					Dashboard in the new kernel. It was impossible
					to just “dd” an old Dashboard image onto newer
					Xboxes.</li>
					<li>Still no major problem for hackers: The second
					executable on the hard disk, “xonlinedash”,
					which is used for Xbox Live configuration, had
					the same bug, so it was possible to copy the old
					“xonlinedash” and to rename it to “xboxdash” to
					make it crash because of the faulty fonts.</li>
					<li>Microsoft consequently blacklisted the vulnerable
					version of “xonlinedash”.</li>
					<li>Again, no major problem for hackers: All Xbox
					Live games come with the “dashupdate” application,
					which adds Xbox Live functionality to the
					Dashboard for the first Xboxes which came without
					it. This update application has the same font
					bug, and it can be run from hard disk. So it is
					possible to copy the file from any Xbox Live
					game DVD, rename it to “xboxdash” and let it
					crash.</li>
					<li>Microsoft could not blacklist this one. Xbox Live
					enabled games run the update application every
					time they start, making sure the Xbox has the
					Xbox Live functionality. Blacklisting “dashupdate”
					would break these games.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We won.

				<h2>
					The Mistakes that Have Been Made
				</h2>
				<p>
					Microsoft obviously made a lot of mistakes. But it
					would be too easy to just attribute all these to stupid
					engineers. There have been good (and different)
					reasons for most of these mistakes, and one can
					learn a lot from them.
					There are 17 kinds of mistakes they made, several
					of which have been made more than once. I will
					group the 17 mistake types into three categories:
					Design mistakes, implementation mistakes and bad
					policy decisions.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="design">
				<h2>
					Design
				</h2>
				<h4>#1: Security vs. Money</h4>
				<p>
					Be very careful with tradeoffs between security
					and money. There are rarely sensible compromises.
					Keep in mind that the very reason for the security
					system is to make more money, or to prevent money
					losses. Security systems cannot be “a little better” or
					“a little worse”. Either they are effective - or they
					are not. By saving money on the security system,
					you may easily make it not effective at all, not only
					wasting the money spent on the security system, but
					also making losses because it is not effective.
					Microsoft made many compromises.
				</p>
					<ul><li>In-system programming of flash memory is
					cheaper than preprogramming, but an attacker can
					also override the firmware with an LPC ROM.</li>
					<li>Buying all of Samsung's RAM chips is cheaper
					than only buying those within the specs, but it
					made RAM initialization more complex, using up
					space that could otherwise be used for better security
					code.</li>
					<li>They chose to put the secret ROM into the Southbridge
					instead of the CPU, because the Southbridge
					was a custom component anyway and having
					a custom CPU would have been a lot more
					expensive, but keys travel over a visible bus if the
					secret ROM is outside the CPU.</li>
					<li>They saved money choosing not to update the
					Southbridge a second time, which would have
					fixed the TEA hash and removed the visor backdoor.
					This would have made modchips virtually
					impossible.</li>
					</ul>
				<h4>#2: Security vs. Speed</h4>
				<p>
					Don't trade security for speed. Although it may be
					true that the product in question must be as fast as
					possible in order to be able to compete with similar
					products on the market, remember that in IT, computers
					aren't slower or faster by some percentage -
					but but factors! Besides, you might lose more
					money because of a security system that does not
					work than because of a product that is 10 percent
					slower than it could be.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most probably for added speed (one address space,
					no TLB misses), Microsoft chose to run all code in
					kernel mode, even games that interacted with untrusted
					data that came from the outside. This made it
					possible to have complete control of the machine
					once a game crashed because of a prepared savegame,
					including complete control of the hard disk
					and the possibility of booting another operating
					system.
				</p>
				<h4>#3: Combinations of Weaknesses</h4>
				<p>
					Be aware of the fact that a combination of security
					flaws can lead to a successful attack. Don't think
					that a possible security hole (or “only” a security
					risk) cannot be exploited because there are so many
					barriers in front of it. Attackers might break all the
					other barriers that block the vulnerability, and fixing
					that one hole would have stopped them.
					MechInstaller is a great example for that. It was
					only possible because of the combination of several
					security weaknesses:
				</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The boot process was vulnerable, so we could use
					a modified kernel to analyze games.</li>
					<li>Some games are not careful enough with savegames,
					so that we can run our own code.</li>
					<li>Games run in kernel mode, so we have full control
					of the hardware.</li>
					<li>The Dashboard does not verify the integrity of the
					font files.</li>
					<li>The Dashboard has a vulnerability in the font code.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					If any of these weaknesses had not been there, then
					MechInstaller would not have been possible. Also
					note that hackers have enough fantasy to find out
					these combinations.
				</p>
				<h4>#4: Hackers' Resources</h4>
				<p>
					Understand that hackers may have excellent resources.
					Hobbyists may use resources from work or
					from university, and professional attackers can also
					be very well-equipped. It is a big mistake to underestimate
					them. So never think you are safe because
					it would be too much work or too expensive to exploit
					a weakness. If it is a weakness, it will eventually
					be exploited. Also understand that hackers may 
					have excellent human resources. Not only in number,
					but also in qualifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Microsoft put the secret ROM into the Southbridge
					instead of the CPU, which meant that the secret key
					would travel over a visible bus. This is the very fast
					HyperTransport bus, which, at that time, could not
					be sniffed using logic analyzers any mortal could
					afford. But with help of the resources of the MIT
					and using all of his expertise, bunnie could build his
					own hardware that could sniff the bus.
				</p>
				<h4>#5: Barriers and Obstacles</h4>
				<p>
					Don't make anything “harder for hackers”. Instead
					make it “impossible for hackers”, or, if it cannot be
					made impossible, don't care about it. Because of the
					potential great number and excellent qualifications
					of hackers, no obstacle will have any effect or slow
					down hacking significantly. But instead, in security
					design, you might make mistake #3, because you
					think you are safe as there are so many obstacles in
					the hackers' way. Use the resources you would invest
					into building obstacles into building or
					strengthening barriers instead - possibly at a different
					location.
				</p>
				<p>
					Microsoft built obstacles into the system at many
					different locations.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Savegames will only be accepted if they are
					signed, but the private key is of course stored inside
					the game, so this is no barrier. Instead, they
					should have made sure the games contain no buffer
					vulnerabilities in their savegame handlers.</li>
					<li>The hard disk is secured with an ATA password,
					different for every Xbox and stored on an EEPROM
					inside the Xbox, but an attacker can just
					“hotswap” an unlocked hard disk from a running
					Xbox to a running PC. Instead, they should have
					put that energy into verifying whether the Dashboard
					really hashes all data it reads from the hard
					disk.</li>
					<li>The 512 bytes of security startup code were embedded
					in a custom chip to make it hard to sniff.
					Instead, they should have made sure that there are
					no bugs in that security code.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>#6: Hacker Groups</h4>
					<p>Don't use one security system for different purposes,
					or else attackers with very different goals
					will jointly attack it, being a lot more effective.
					Instead, try to find out who your enemies really are
					and what they want, and design your security system
					so that every group gets as much of what they
					want so that it does not hurt you.</p>
					<p>There were three possible goals for Xbox hackers:
					Run Linux and use it as a computer, run homebrew
					software like media players and emulators, and run
					copies Although there were some overlaps between
					Linux and homebrew people, as well as between
					homebrew people and people interested in copies,
					these were essentially three very different groups.
					Because they were all locked out by the same protection,
					they worked together, either explicitly, or
					implicitly, by using the results of each other. No
					Linux hackers ever attacked the Playstation. When
					you are fair, people don't fight you.</p>
				<h4>#7: Security by Obscurity</h4>
					<p>Security by obscurity does not work. Well-proven
					algorithms like SHA-1 and RSA work (of course
					given your implementation is well-proven as well).
					Microsoft hid the secret ROM, the Windows kernel,
					the game DVD contents (no way to read them
					on a standard DVD drive) and the hard disk contents
					using different methods. None had any effect.</p>
					<p>Also see #5.</p>
				<h4>#8: Fixes</h4>
					<p>When your security system has been broken, don't
					release quick fixes, for two reasons: Your fixes may
					be flawed and may not actually correct the problem,
					and even worse holes may be found not much later,
					which you must fix again - and ship yet another version.
					Instead, every time a security vulnerability is
					found, audit your complete security system and
					search for similar bugs, as well as other bugs in the
					same part of the system, based on the knowledge
					you gained from the successful hack.</p>
					<p>Microsoft failed to correct the hash problem in the
					second version of the secret ROM, and didn't fix the
					visor vulnerability, which was found just weeks
					later. After trashing thousands of already manufactured
					v1.0 Southbridge chips, which was very expensive,
					they decided not to update the Southbridge
					a second time. Another example is the dashboard
					odyssey: Instead of blacklisting the vulnerable executables
					at a time, they released three updates,
					none of which was effective.</p>
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="implementation">
				<h2>
					Implementation
				</h2>
				<p>
					<h4>#9: Data Sheets</h4>
					<p>Know everything about the components you use.
					Do read data sheets. Be very careful with components
					that have legacy functionality.</p>
					<p>Microsoft did not notice the A20# legacy functionality
					as a security risk. It seems that they did not
					completely analyze the functionality of the Pentium
					III Celeron, or else they should have noticed. They
					also apparently did not read the Pentium programmers'
					manual, or else they would have noticed that
					Intel CPUs do not panic on a FFFFFFFF/00000000
					wraparound.</p>
					<h4>#10: Literature</h4>
					<p>Read (at least!) standard literature. If you are
					dealing with cryptography, this means you have to
					read at last Schneier's “Applied Cryptography”.
					<p>Microsoft's engineers did not know that TEA must
					not be used as a hash, and that RC4 does not feed
					the decrypted stream back into the key stream.</p>
					<h4>#11: Pros</h4>
					<p>Get experienced professionals to work on your
					security system, both on the design and the implementation.
					If it's a money issue, see #1.</p>
					<p>Looking at mistakes #9 and #10, it seems very
					probable that at least some of Microsoft's engineers
					had no prior experience with cryptography or the
					design of a security system. We also know that people
					on an internship were working on Xbox security.</p>
					<h4>#12: Completeness</h4>
					<p>Check whether your security code catches all
					cases. If it does not, you did not only waste time
					implementing all of it, but you may also give hints
					to hackers: If there are many checks at one point of
					the code, it looks a lot like code that is relevant for
					security and an attacker can check whether all cases
					are caught.</p>
					<p>Microsoft made this mistake twice: The xcode
					interpreter tests for the secret ROM turnoff code,
					and doesn't catch all cases. And the Dashboard
					hashes all files it is going to read, except for two.
					This gave us the ideas where to attack.</p>
					<h4>#13: Leftovers</h4>
					<p>Look at the final product from the perspective of a
					hacker. Hexdump and disassemble your final builds.
					There could be leftovers!</p>
					<p>The Xbox flash memory image contained an old
					version of the secret ROM, giving us not only hints
					about the contents of the actual secret ROM, but
					also an insight into what Microsoft planned and why
					some mistakes have been made.</p>
					<h4>#14: Final Test</h4>
					<p>Test your security system when you have the final
					parts and with the final software components in
					place. Changing something may very well open
					holes somewhere else. When you change something,
					rethink the complete system, and check all
					assumptions that you made.</p>
					<p>The visor hack was only possible because Microsoft
					failed to adapt their security system, designed
					for the AMD CPU, to the Intel CPU. The “hash” in
					the secret ROM had no effect because they changed
					RC5 to RC4 without thinking about the implications.
				</p>
				</section>
				<section id="policies">
				<h2>
					Policies
				</h2>
				<p>
					<h4>#15: Source</h4>
					<p>Keep your source safe. Find engineers you can
					trust.
					<p>The complete Xbox source code has leaked, including
					the kernel and libraries source. Groups interested
					in copies could easily modify it to support
					running games from hard disk, support for hard
					disks bigger than 137 GB, custom boot logos etc.
					This had been previously done by patching the binary.</p>
					<h4>#16: Many People</h4>
					<p>Have many good people have a look at both your
					design and your implementation. Keeping your
					source code safe means having engineers you can
					trust, and not letting none of your engineers see the
					source code. As stated at #7, your system should not
					rely on the source code being safe. Unless you did
					#7 completely wrong, a bug in the security system is
					typically a lot worse than a leak of the source code.
					<p>It seems a lot like very few people have actually
					seen the Xbox security code.</p>
					<h4>#17: Talk</h4>
					<p>Know your enemy - and talk to them. They are not
					terrorists that you are not supposed to negotiate
					with. Their intent is not to harm you but to reach
					their goals. Working on their goals on their own
					might harm you indirectly, because the hackers may
					not care about the same things as you do. Seek the
					contact to hackers, know what they are doing and
					have them inform you about a vulnerability before
					publishing it. Make them know your position and
					why they should respect it, but also respect their
					position. Offer them to loosen the security system
					for what they want in exchange for the nondisclosure
					of their findings.</p>
					<p>Microsoft refused to talk about the savegame and
					font vulnerabilities. If we had been bad hackers, we
					could have released both of them as-is, immediately
					making it possible to run copies on Xboxes without
					the use of a modchip. Instead, we sought contact to
					Microsoft: We would have preferred to see a backdoor
					for Linux in the Xbox security system, instead
					of a solution based on our findings that would allow
					running copies. But as they refused to talk, we were
					forced to release the exploits, and they were lucky
					we heavily obfuscated our solutions so in order to
					slow down people interested in using it for copies.
